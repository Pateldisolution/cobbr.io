It's the time of year for the CCDC. If you aren't familiar with CCDC, it's a collegiate competition where clueless college kids defend intentionally insecure networks against teams of seasoned red teamers. Basically, it's a lot of fun.

I was lucky enough to have started a band of my own clueless college kids last year when I was in school. My experience has been that it can be difficult for a new team to prepare for a competition without much backing from the school in the way of finances and equipment. After a few months of "preparing" for a network-defense competition without a practice network, we competed in our first CCDC qualifier competition. Needless to say, no, we didn't qualify.

My experience is probably common among new teams, and maybe time and practice is the only real remedy. In fact, a year further in, that band of clueless college kids I left behind are a lot less clueless this year. However, what I would really like to see is more commitment from schools to support education around Information Security, especially to their students who have committed themselves to spend tons of time outside of classes to prepare to compete in competitions like these.

One very small piece of this larger problem, is that we really had no clue what exactly was being *scored* on the network we were supposed to be defending. During the competition we were shown a "scoreboard", if you could call it that, that basically just said "DNS is failing" or "DNS is passing". It gave no context as to what DNS request was being made to what machine, what the result of the request was, or why the request was considered to be failing.

I've developed a tool I'm calling [Judge](https://github.com/cobbr/Judge) that could help with this problem. Judge is a scoreboard and a tool for debugging network services on a CCDC (or similar competition) network. It could be used during a team's practice sessions to keep score and measure progress over time. It could also be used by a team during a competition to quickly debug failing services on the network.

Judge is implemented as a python Flask web app. This is what the scoreboard looks like:

And, scrolling down the page, you see more details:

The scoreboard provides context to how your team is performing relative to other teams. And as the second screenshot shows, it is easy to tell when and what services are failing or passing at any time.

Where I think Judge can really help out teams is with it's debugging capability. The Errors page shows all currently failing services on the network, and shows the detailed error message that is causing the service to fail.

These error messages give a team some real context as to what is happening on their network, and saves them time correcting the error.

Long term, I would love to see the CCDC and other competitions adopt a scoreboard like Judge.

But even if that never happens, I hope it is useful to some college kid out there.
