I work as a pentester and consultant at [Protiviti](https://www.protiviti.com/).

I intend for this blog to be a platform to document and share the things I am working on or interest me. I don't claim to be an expert.

Some projects I am currently working on:

* [ObfuscatedEmpire](https://github.com/cobbr/ObfuscatedEmpire) - An integration of [Empire](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire) and [Invoke-Obfuscation](https://github.com/danielbohannon/Invoke-Obfuscation), for automating obfuscation within a PowerShell C2 channel. Introductory blog post and full explanation available [here]({{site.baseurl}}/ObfuscatedEmpire.html). Soon to be merged upstream (hopefully).

Presentations:

* **"Obfuscating The Empire" - BSides Austin 2017** - An introduction to PowerShell logging capabilities, the Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI) introduced in Windows 10, and how to use obfuscation to evade AV signatures. Included demos of [ObfuscatedEmpire](https://github.com/cobbr/ObfuscatedEmpire), an integration of [Invoke-Obfuscation](https://github.com/danielbohannon/Invoke-Obfuscation) and [Empire](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire). [Slides available here](https://www.slideshare.net/RyanCobb16/obfuscating-the-empire).
