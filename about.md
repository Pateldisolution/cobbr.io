I work as a pentester and consultant at [Protiviti](https://www.protiviti.com/).

I intend for this blog to be a platform to document and share the things I am working on or interest me. I don't claim to be an expert.

Some projects I am currently working on:

* [ObfuscatedEmpire](https://github.com/cobbr/ObfuscatedEmpire) - An integration of Empire and Invoke-Obfuscation, for automating obfuscation within a PowerShell C2 channel. Introductory blog post and full explanation available [here]({{site.baseurl}}/ObfuscatedEmpire.html). Soon to be merged upstream (hopefully).
